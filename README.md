Qaalbi Events is an event planning business that was founded by one of our group members. It addresses the client/consumers needs for every type of event. We saw the plugin that  was being used from squarespace and agreed to take on the challenge of coding all aspects of the page ourselves. This was a perfect chance to showcase the skills we cultivated during the first month of the coding bootcamp.This also gave us an opportunity to add features that the website never had and add functional as well as make the page more interactive. We created a form that spits out info onto firebase. This solves the problem of having to receive information via different email addresses and having it readily available to Qaalbi Events in an easily readable format.
